think_stats
===========

This is a repository of my solutions to exercises presented in Allen Downey's _Think Stats_.

Due to license considerations, I do not include Downey's own code or the datasets used in the book. (Downey's text is generously licensed, but I couldn't find any license info for his code. Nor do I have any right to redistribute the datasets used in the book.)

For more info on where these files should go, please see this blog post: http://www.jeremy-boyd.com/2012/09/18/setting-up-your-python-environment-for-think-stats/.

Note: I make no representations as to the accuracy of these exercises. I'm learning as I go, and I fully expect to make mistakes along the way.
