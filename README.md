think_stats
===========

This is a repository of my solutions to exercises presented in Allen Downey's _Think Stats_.

Due to license restrictions, I do not include Downey's own code or the datasets used in the book.

For more info on where these files should go, please see this blog post: http://www.jeremy-boyd.com/2012/09/18/setting-up-your-python-environment-for-think-stats/.
